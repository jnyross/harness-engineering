## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- Implemented `pi agent` delegation by wiring pods model endpoints into coding-agent via a temporary runtime provider extension.
- Added graceful validation for missing `--pod` overrides in `pi agent`.
- Ensured delegated agent failures propagate with non-zero exit codes instead of reporting success.
- Prevented conflicting `--provider` / `--model` overrides in `pi agent` mode so routing stays bound to selected pod model.
- Avoided writing resolved API keys into temporary extension files by passing keys through child-process environment only.
- Switched delegated provider naming to unique per-run IDs (`pods-vllm-<random>`) to avoid provider namespace collisions.
